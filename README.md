# PokerBuddy-Chipless-Poker-Companion
PokerBuddy is a wireless, chipless device designed to streamline in-person poker games by replacing physical chips and automatic tracking with electronic components. Each device manages game logic locally, including pot size tracking, player balances, and turn order. We accomplish this by using a microcontroller, tactile chip-value buttons, gesture sensors, and visual indicators. Devices communicate wirelessly to maintain a synchronized game state across all players. The system demonstrated accurate real-time updates with over 98% input recognition and consistent pot/balance tracking. It maintained reliable communication within an 8-foot radius and successfully integrated hardware and software for seamless gameplay. The final design achieved full functionality, demonstrating the feasibility of enhancing traditional poker with embedded systems while preserving the face-to-face experience.
